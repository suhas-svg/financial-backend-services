# Comprehensive Audit Logging and Monitoring Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive audit logging and monitoring features implemented for the Transaction Service.

## Overview

Task 14 has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Structured JSON Logging for Transaction Operations ✅

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `AuditService` with structured JSON logging using Logstash Logback Encoder
- Created `AuditEvent` DTO for structured audit event representation
- Implemented `AuditLoggingAspect` for automatic logging of controller and service methods
- Configured separate audit log files with rotation and retention policies

**Key Features:**
- Transaction lifecycle logging (initiated, completed, failed, reversed)
- Account validation and balance check logging
- Security event logging (authentication, authorization failures)
- API access logging with response times and status codes
- System event logging for maintenance and health activities

**Log Files:**
- `logs/transaction-service.log` - General application logs
- `logs/transaction-audit.log` - Dedicated audit trail logs (90-day retention)

### 2. Audit Trails for Transaction Processing ✅

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive audit logging in `AuditService` covering all transaction operations
- MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for correlation tracking
- Detailed logging of transaction state changes and business rule validations

**Audit Events Captured:**
- Transaction initiation with all parameters
- Account validation results
- Balance checks and limit validations
- Transaction completion with processing times
- Transaction failures with error codes and messages
- Transaction reversals with reasons
- Security events and access attempts

### 3. Custom Metrics for Transaction Volume and Success Rates ✅

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `MetricsService` with comprehensive transaction metrics
- Integration with Micrometer and Prometheus for metrics collection
- Real-time tracking of transaction performance and business metrics

**Metrics Collected:**
- Transaction counters by type and status
- Transaction processing duration timers
- Daily transaction volume and amounts
- Success/failure rates
- Active transaction counts
- Account service integration metrics
- Error counters by type (insufficient funds, account not found, etc.)

**Prometheus Endpoints:**
- `/actuator/prometheus` - Prometheus metrics scraping endpoint
- `/actuator/metrics` - Individual metrics inspection

### 4. Health Checks for Dependencies ✅

**Implementation:**
- Custom health indicators for all critical dependencies
- Comprehensive health monitoring with detailed status reporting
- Automated health check scheduling and alerting

**Health Indicators Implemented:**

#### DatabaseHealthIndicator
- PostgreSQL connectivity testing
- Connection validation with test queries
- Database version and configuration reporting
- Connection pool status monitoring

#### RedisHealthIndicator
- Redis connectivity with PING/PONG testing
- Basic operation testing (SET/GET/DELETE)
- Redis server information (version, memory usage, clients)
- Connection factory validation

#### AccountServiceHealthIndicator
- HTTP connectivity to Account Service
- Health endpoint validation
- Response time monitoring
- Service availability tracking

#### TransactionServiceHealthIndicator
- Overall service health assessment
- JVM memory usage monitoring
- Transaction processing metrics integration
- System uptime and performance indicators

**Health Endpoints:**
- `/actuator/health` - Standard Spring Boot health endpoint
- `/api/monitoring/status` - Comprehensive system status
- `/api/monitoring/health/dependencies` - Dependency health summary
- `/api/monitoring/health/check` - Manual health check trigger

## Configuration

### Application Properties
```properties
# Actuator endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics,prometheus,httpexchanges
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.endpoint.health.show-components=always

# Metrics configuration
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
management.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram.http.server.requests=true

# Audit logging configuration
audit.logging.enabled=true
audit.logging.include-request-details=true
audit.logging.max-payload-length=1000
```

### Logback Configuration
- Structured JSON logging with Logstash encoder
- Separate audit log appender with async processing
- Log rotation and retention policies
- Environment-specific logging levels

## Monitoring Endpoints

### System Status
- `GET /api/monitoring/status` - Complete system health and metrics
- `GET /api/monitoring/metrics/transactions` - Transaction-specific metrics
- `GET /api/monitoring/metrics/performance` - System performance metrics

### Health Monitoring
- `GET /api/monitoring/health/dependencies` - All dependency health status
- `GET /api/monitoring/health/check` - Manual health check execution

### Actuator Endpoints
- `GET /actuator/health` - Spring Boot health endpoint
- `GET /actuator/metrics` - Available metrics list
- `GET /actuator/prometheus` - Prometheus metrics format

## Scheduled Tasks

### ScheduledMetricsService
- **Pending Transactions Update** (every minute) - Updates pending transaction counts
- **Daily Counter Reset** (daily at midnight) - Resets daily transaction counters
- **Health Metrics Logging** (every 5 minutes) - Logs system health metrics
- **Daily Summary Report** (daily at 11:30 PM) - Generates transaction summary
- **Audit Log Cleanup** (weekly on Sunday) - Maintains audit log retention

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `AuditServiceTest` - Validates audit logging functionality
- `MetricsServiceTest` - Tests metrics collection and reporting
- `MonitoringIntegrationTest` - Integration tests for monitoring endpoints

### Test Coverage
- All audit logging methods tested
- Metrics collection and retrieval validated
- Health indicator functionality verified
- Monitoring endpoints tested

## Security Considerations

- Sensitive data masking in logs (passwords, tokens)
- Audit trail integrity with structured logging
- Access control for monitoring endpoints
- Rate limiting for health check endpoints

## Performance Impact

- Async logging to minimize performance impact
- Efficient metrics collection with Micrometer
- Optimized health checks with timeouts
- Log rotation to manage disk usage

## Compliance and Audit

- Comprehensive audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Structured logging for easy parsing and analysis
- Retention policies for audit logs (90 days)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Prometheus metrics for external monitoring systems
- Health check failures logged as system events
- Performance degradation detection
- Transaction success rate monitoring

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 9.1** - Structured JSON logging for all transaction operations
✅ **Requirement 9.2** - Audit trails for transaction processing  
✅ **Requirement 9.5** - Custom metrics for transaction volume and success rates
✅ **Requirement 8.1** - Database health checks
✅ **Requirement 8.2** - Redis health checks  
✅ **Requirement 8.3** - Account Service health checks

3. Implement automated alerting based on health checks
4. Add custom business metrics as needed
5. Configure log shipping to centralized logging system
