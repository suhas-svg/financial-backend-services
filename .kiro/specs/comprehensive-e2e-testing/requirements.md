# Comprehensive E2E Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing solution for the financial backend application consisting of Account Service and Transaction Service. The testing solution will validate all endpoints, service integrations, and complete user workflows to ensure the system functions correctly as a whole.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Infrastructure Testing

6. WHEN testing account management endpoints THEN the system SHALL test account updates and balance modifications
7. WHEN testing account management endpoints THEN the system SHALL test account deletion and error scenarios
8. WHEN testing filtering endpoints THEN the system SHALL test account filtering by ownerId and accountType
9. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 3: Transaction Service Endpoint Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test all Transaction Service endpoints individually, so that I can verify transaction processing works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing transaction creation THEN the system SHALL test deposit transactions with valid and invalid amounts
2. WHEN testing transaction creation THEN the system SHALL test withdrawal transactions with sufficient and insufficient funds
3. WHEN testing transaction creation THEN the system SHALL test transfer transactions between valid accounts
4. WHEN testing transaction retrieval THEN the system SHALL test getting transactions by ID, account, and user
5. WHEN testing transaction filtering THEN the system SHALL test transaction search with various filters (type, status, date range, amount range)
6. WHEN testing transaction statistics THEN the system SHALL test account and user transaction statistics
7. WHEN testing transaction reversal THEN the system SHALL test transaction reversal functionality
8. WHEN testing transaction limits THEN the system SHALL test transaction limit validation
9. WHEN testing pagination THEN the system SHALL test transaction history pagination and sorting

### Requirement 4: Service Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the integration between Account Service and Transaction Service, so that I can verify they communicate correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is processed THEN the Transaction Service SHALL successfully call Account Service to validate account existence
2. WHEN a transaction is processed THEN the Transaction Service SHALL successfully call Account Service to update account balances
3. WHEN account balance updates fail THEN the Transaction Service SHALL handle the error gracefully and rollback
4. WHEN JWT tokens are used THEN both services SHALL validate tokens consistently
5. WHEN service-to-service calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms and error handling
6. WHEN testing authentication flow THEN tokens generated by Account Service SHALL be accepted by Transaction Service

### Requirement 5: End-to-End User Workflow Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test complete user workflows from start to finish, so that I can verify the entire system works as expected for real user scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing complete user journey THEN the system SHALL test user registration, login, account creation, and transaction processing in sequence
2. WHEN testing deposit workflow THEN the system SHALL verify account creation, deposit transaction, and balance update
3. WHEN testing withdrawal workflow THEN the system SHALL verify sufficient funds check, withdrawal processing, and balance update
4. WHEN testing transfer workflow THEN the system SHALL verify both account validations, transfer processing, and balance updates for both accounts
5. WHEN testing transaction history THEN the system SHALL verify that all transactions appear correctly in user and account history
6. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling throughout the complete workflow
7. WHEN testing concurrent transactions THEN the system SHALL verify that concurrent operations don't cause data inconsistencies

### Requirement 6: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test system performance under load, so that I can verify the system can handle expected traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running load tests THEN the system SHALL test multiple concurrent user registrations and logins
2. WHEN running load tests THEN the system SHALL test multiple concurrent account creations
3. WHEN running load tests THEN the system SHALL test multiple concurrent transaction processing
4. WHEN measuring response times THEN the system SHALL verify that 95% of requests complete within acceptable time limits
5. WHEN testing database performance THEN the system SHALL verify that database connections are properly managed
6. WHEN testing cache performance THEN the system SHALL verify that Redis caching improves response times

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency and Integrity Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify data consistency across services, so that I can ensure financial data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL verify that account balances are accurately updated
2. WHEN transactions fail THEN the system SHALL verify that no partial updates occur
3. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL verify that race conditions don't cause data corruption
4. WHEN testing transaction reversal THEN the system SHALL verify that balances are correctly restored
5. WHEN testing database constraints THEN the system SHALL verify that invalid data is rejected
6. WHEN testing audit trails THEN the system SHALL verify that all operations are properly logged

### Requirement 8: Security Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test security aspects of the system, so that I can verify that sensitive financial data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify that unauthenticated requests are rejected
2. WHEN testing authorization THEN the system SHALL verify that users can only access their own data
3. WHEN testing JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL verify token expiration and validation
4. WHEN testing input validation THEN the system SHALL verify that malicious inputs are rejected
5. WHEN testing sensitive endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify that proper security headers are present
6. WHEN testing password handling THEN the system SHALL verify that passwords are properly hashed

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms, so that I can verify the system handles failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
2. WHEN service dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
3. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return clear validation error messages
4. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL handle resource constraints appropriately
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry and circuit breaker patterns

### Requirement 10: Test Reporting and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test reports and documentation, so that I can understand test results and system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria
