# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Transaction Service is a comprehensive financial transaction processing microservice that handles all monetary transactions within the financial system. Built with Spring Boot 3.5.3 and Java 22, it provides secure, auditable, and scalable transaction processing capabilities including transfers between accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and comprehensive transaction history management. The service integrates seamlessly with the Account Service to ensure data consistency and provides real-time balance validation and transaction limit enforcement. The service is currently implemented with core functionality in place and requires completion of testing, monitoring, and advanced features.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a financial system user, I want to view my transaction history, so that I can track all my financial activities and maintain records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their transaction history THEN the system SHALL return all transactions associated with their accounts
2. WHEN transaction history is requested THEN the system SHALL include transaction ID, type, amount, timestamp, and account details
3. WHEN a user requests transaction history with date filters THEN the system SHALL return only transactions within the specified date range
4. WHEN transaction history is requested THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large result sets
5. WHEN a specific transaction ID is requested THEN the system SHALL return detailed transaction information if it exists

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a financial system administrator, I want to enforce transaction limits, so that I can prevent fraud and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL check if it exceeds configured daily transaction limits
2. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL check if it exceeds configured monthly transaction limits
3. WHEN transaction limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN transaction limits are configured THEN the system SHALL store and apply them per account or user
5. IF no specific limits are configured THEN the system SHALL apply default system-wide transaction limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a financial system administrator, I want to reverse transactions when necessary, so that I can correct errors and handle dispute resolutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction reversal is requested with valid transaction ID THEN the system SHALL validate the original transaction exists
2. WHEN a transaction is reversed THEN the system SHALL create a compensating transaction that undoes the original transaction
3. WHEN a reversal is processed THEN the system SHALL update account balances to reflect the reversal
4. WHEN a transaction is already reversed THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate reversals
5. WHEN a reversal is completed THEN the system SHALL link the reversal transaction to the original transaction for audit purposes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a financial system user, I want secure authentication for all transaction operations, so that my financial data and operations are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any transaction endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL require a valid JWT authentication token
