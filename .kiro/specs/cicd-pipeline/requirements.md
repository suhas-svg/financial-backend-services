# CI/CD Pipeline Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the Account Service financial microservice. The pipeline will automate the entire software delivery process from code commit to production deployment, ensuring security, quality, and reliability standards for a production-grade financial application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Source Code Management Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger when I push code changes, so that my changes are immediately validated and potentially deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code to the main branch THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL automatically trigger
2. WHEN a developer creates a pull request THEN the pipeline SHALL run validation checks without deploying
3. WHEN code is pushed to feature branches THEN the pipeline SHALL run tests and security scans only
4. IF the pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL prevent merging to main branch
5. WHEN pipeline completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback and artifacts

### Requirement 2: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive automated testing in the pipeline, so that we catch bugs and maintain code quality before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code enters the pipeline THEN the system SHALL run unit tests with minimum 80% coverage
2. WHEN unit tests pass THEN the system SHALL run integration tests against a test database
3. WHEN integration tests pass THEN the system SHALL run security vulnerability scans
4. WHEN security scans pass THEN the system SHALL run code quality analysis (SonarQube/similar)
5. IF any test fails THEN the pipeline SHALL stop and report detailed failure information
6. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate test reports and coverage metrics

### Requirement 3: Container Image Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated container image building and management, so that we have consistent, secure, and versioned deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build a Docker image with proper tagging
2. WHEN image is built THEN the system SHALL scan the image for security vulnerabilities
3. WHEN image passes security scan THEN the system SHALL push to container registry
4. WHEN pushing to registry THEN the system SHALL tag images with git commit SHA and semantic version
5. IF image has critical vulnerabilities THEN the pipeline SHALL fail and block deployment
6. WHEN image is pushed THEN the system SHALL sign the image for supply chain security

### Requirement 4: Multi-Environment Deployment

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want automated deployment to multiple environments with proper promotion gates, so that we can safely deliver features to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image is ready THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to development environment
2. WHEN development deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests
3. WHEN smoke tests pass THEN the system SHALL deploy to staging environment with approval gate
4. WHEN staging is approved THEN the system SHALL deploy to production with manual approval
5. IF any deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to previous version
6. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run health checks and notify stakeholders

### Requirement 5: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the pipeline to enforce security policies and compliance requirements, so that we maintain security standards for financial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code enters pipeline THEN the system SHALL scan for secrets and sensitive data
2. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL check for known vulnerabilities
3. WHEN container is built THEN the system SHALL scan image with Trivy or similar tool
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL verify Kubernetes security policies are applied
5. IF security violations are found THEN the pipeline SHALL fail and create security tickets
6. WHEN security scans pass THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports

### Requirement 6: Infrastructure as Code

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure managed as code through the pipeline, so that we have consistent and reproducible environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate Terraform/Helm configurations
2. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL plan infrastructure changes
3. WHEN plan is approved THEN the system SHALL apply infrastructure changes
4. IF infrastructure deployment fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous state
5. WHEN infrastructure is updated THEN the system SHALL update documentation automatically
6. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL run infrastructure tests

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Observability Integration

**User Story:** As an SRE, I want the pipeline to integrate with monitoring systems, so that we have visibility into deployment success and application health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment starts THEN the system SHALL create deployment markers in monitoring tools
2. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify application metrics are healthy
3. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and automatic rollback
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL update service catalogs and dashboards
5. IF performance degrades post-deployment THEN the system SHALL alert and suggest rollback
6. WHEN rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL log incident details for post-mortem analysis

### Requirement 8: Notification and Communication

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive relevant notifications about pipeline status, so that I can respond quickly to issues or celebrate successes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline starts THEN the system SHALL notify relevant team members via Slack/Teams
2. WHEN pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL send detailed failure notifications with logs
3. WHEN deployment to production completes THEN the system SHALL notify all stakeholders
4. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL immediately alert security team
5. IF rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL notify incident response team
6. WHEN pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL update project dashboards and metrics

### Requirement 9: Backup and Disaster Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backup and recovery procedures in the pipeline, so that we can quickly recover from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL create database backup before deployment
2. WHEN backup completes THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL have option to restore from backup
4. IF disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated recovery procedures
5. WHEN recovery completes THEN the system SHALL validate system functionality
6. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL manage retention policies automatically

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability Testing

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want automated performance testing in the pipeline, so that we ensure the application meets performance requirements under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staging deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run automated performance tests
2. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic financial transaction loads
3. WHEN load testing completes THEN the system SHALL compare results against performance baselines
4. IF performance degrades beyond thresholds THEN the pipeline SHALL fail and block promotion
5. WHEN performance tests pass THEN the system SHALL update performance metrics dashboard
6. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL generate detailed performance reports
