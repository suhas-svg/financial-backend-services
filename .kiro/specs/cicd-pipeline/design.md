## Data Models

### Pipeline Configuration Model

```yaml
pipeline:
  name: account-service-cicd
  triggers:
    - push: [main, develop]
    - pull_request: [main]
    - schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Nightly builds
  
  stages:
    - name: validate
      parallel: true
      jobs: [lint, security-scan, unit-tests]
    
    - name: build
      depends_on: [validate]
      jobs: [docker-build, image-scan]
    
    - name: deploy-dev
      depends_on: [build]
      environment: development
      auto_deploy: true
    
    - name: test-integration
      depends_on: [deploy-dev]
      jobs: [integration-tests, smoke-tests]
    
    - name: deploy-staging
      depends_on: [test-integration]
      environment: staging
      approval_required: true
    
    - name: test-performance
      depends_on: [deploy-staging]
      jobs: [load-tests, security-tests]
    
    - name: deploy-production
      depends_on: [test-performance]
      environment: production
      approval_required: true
      rollback_enabled: true
```

### Deployment Configuration Model

```yaml
deployment:
  strategy: rolling-update
  replicas:
    min: 3
    max: 10
  health_checks:
    liveness: /actuator/health/liveness
    readiness: /actuator/health/readiness
    startup: /actuator/health
  
  rollback:
    enabled: true
    automatic_triggers:
      - health_check_failure
      - error_rate_threshold: 5%
      - response_time_threshold: 2s
  
  monitoring:
    metrics_endpoint: /actuator/prometheus
    alerts:
      - high_error_rate
      - high_response_time
      - low_availability
```

## Error Handling

### Pipeline Failure Scenarios

1. **Build Failures**
   - Compilation errors → Immediate notification to developer
   - Test failures → Detailed test report with failure analysis
   - Security scan failures → Block deployment, create security ticket

2. **Deployment Failures**
   - Infrastructure failures → Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Application startup failures → Automatic rollback to previous version
   - Health check failures → Circuit breaker pattern, alert operations team

3. **Security Violations**
   - Critical vulnerabilities → Immediate pipeline halt, security team notification
   - License compliance issues → Legal team notification, deployment block
   - Secret exposure → Immediate secret rotation, security incident creation

### Error Recovery Strategies

```yaml
error_handling:
  retry_policy:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_strategy: exponential
    retry_conditions:
      - network_timeout
      - temporary_infrastructure_failure
  
  rollback_policy:
    automatic_triggers:
      - deployment_failure
      - health_check_failure
      - performance_degradation
    
    manual_triggers:
      - security_incident
      - business_decision
  
  notification_policy:
    immediate:
      - security_violations
      - production_failures
    
    daily_summary:
      - build_statistics
      - deployment_metrics
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid Implementation

   - TestContainers for database testing
   - Real external service integration
   - End-to-end API testing
   - Contract testing with Pact

    5. complete_switch_or_rollback
```

### Canary Deployment

```yaml

    error_rate: < 1%
    response_time: < 500ms
    
  phases:
    - traffic: 10%
      duration: 5m
    - traffic: 25%
      duration: 10m
    - traffic: 50%
      duration: 15m
    - traffic: 100%
      duration: complete
```
