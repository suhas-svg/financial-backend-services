# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan creates a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using free services and open-source tools, focusing on GitHub Actions as the primary CI/CD platform with integration to free monitoring and security tools.

## Implementation Status

**Current Phase**: Core Pipeline Implementation (Tasks 1-7)  
**Deferred Phase**: Advanced Features (Tasks 8-12)

### Deferred Tasks Rationale
Tasks 8-12 have been deferred to the final project stages to focus on core functionality first:
- **Task 8**: Notification and Communication System
- **Task 9**: Backup and Disaster Recovery Automation  
- **Task 10**: Security Compliance and Audit Trail
- **Task 11**: Pipeline Optimization and Performance
- **Task 12**: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

These advanced features will be implemented when the project reaches production readiness.
